            <p>I really like copypastas. I can truly appreciate the amount of creativity nestled into a big blob of text and recognize how artistic it really is. If you don’t know what a copypasta is, it comes from the phrase “copy and paste” which in computer terms refers to selecting an element (most likely a large paragraph of text that is most likely senseless and rather lengthy) and then either right clicking with the mouse and selecting copy, or by using the keyboard and pressing Ctrl and C. Ctrl is the control key, and this is found on the bottom left corner of your keyboard, or even on the bottom right corner underneath your shift key. After the element has been copied, it is then pasted wherever the user desires by either right clicking the mouse and selecting paste, or by pressing the Ctrl key and V. Copypastas can range from being very inappropriate, touching on subjects that are considered taboo by the status quo, or they can be more appropriate and able to be spread across organizations that don’t tolerate inappropriate topics but are able to appreciate a good laugh at a good, family friendly copypasta! The internet is surely a very beautiful and redeeming place!</p>
